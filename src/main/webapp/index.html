<h1>Rules and Regulations</h1>
<div><p>There are many different traffic rules and regulations that drivers must follow while driving. These rules are designed to keep everyone safe on the roadways. Some of the most important traffic rules to remember include always yielding to pedestrians, obeying traffic signs and signals, and maintaining a safe following distance. By following these and other traffic rules, drivers can help to keep the roads safe for everyone. </p></div>
<div>
<h2>Stop</h2>
<p>Drivers should always be on the lookout for pedestrians, especially in areas where they are more likely to be present such as near schools or in busy city streets. If a driver sees a pedestrian crossing the road, they should immediately stop and yield the right of way. Failing to do so could result in a serious or even fatal accident.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Give Away</h2>
<p>This sign indicates that the traffic on the right has the right of way, and that the traffic on the left should yield to them. This is a common sign in many countries, and is a good reminder to always be aware of who has the right of way in any given situation.</p>

<div>
<h2>Pedestrians Prohibited </h2>
<p>A "no walking" sign indicates that the place is restricted for walking. This is usually due to a danger or hazard that could harm or kill someone if they were to walk in the area.</p>
